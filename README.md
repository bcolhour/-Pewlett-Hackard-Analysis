# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
Pewlett Hackard is facing an upcoming "silver tsunami". A very large number of employees will be reaching retirment age at the same time creating a mass exodus of talent. 

### Objectives
We have been tasked with compiling and analyzing 6 different spreadsheets maintained by the company to determine: 

- Total number and details of employees reaching retirement age
- Total number and details by Dept retiring
- Total number and details by job title retiring
- List of possible employees to target mentorship eligibility

## Results
### Employee retiring by title
- 72458 current employees will be retiring 
- These are distributed over 7 different positions

## Recommendations
1. It is recommended that a career development plan be put in place to cultivate those in the junior roles to be able to move into the senior roles. This will set them up to develop new hires as they come into the entry positions, thus maintaining a perpetual cycle of mentorship and readiness. 
2. It is further recommended to implement the immediate mentorship plan by recruiting retirees to continue to work part time as consultants to develop and launch the mentorship program.
